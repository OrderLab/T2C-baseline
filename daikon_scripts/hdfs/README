#how to use
1. run_all_v2.py, this is to feed traces to daikon and analyze 
2. gen_decl.py, this is an inserted step, because in cassandra we would have several dtraces files that cannot be merged, this is to generate a global pool of declaration
3. merge_javacodes.py, an inserted step too, this is to merge all generated daikon java files
4. gen_pool.py, convert daikon generated java files to executable files for us to use
